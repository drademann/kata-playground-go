# Programming Katas for Go

These Katas are supposed to be done many times like you would learn a craftsmanship, the Software Craftsmanship.
Use TDD, test driven development, to invent your solution to the problem:

1. Write the test first, it should be **red**.
2. Implement the requirement to make the test at hand **green**. But do not implement more than the current test requires.
3. **Refactor** your code while the test stays green
