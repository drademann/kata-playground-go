# Anagram Kata

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the
original letters exactly once.

See

- [codingdojo.org "Anagram Kata"](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Anagram/)
- [Wikipedia "Anagram"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)

Hint: use the provided word list to find matches.

__Remember__:

- Do TDD.
- Do one requirement at a time, don't read ahead.
- Test first, there is no try.

And for this Kata:

- Keep your code readable,
- try to improve performance (benchmarking tests)
- but keep your code readable.
