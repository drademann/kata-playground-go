# Hello Kata

Most simple Kata. While it might not provide much to do in terms of TDD etc.,
it will ensure your system is set up correctly and compiles, tests and runs Go.

__Remember__:

- Do TDD.
- Do one requirement at a time, do not read ahead.
- Test first, there is no try.

## Task

Provide the following function:

    Greet()

It shall print the text "Hello, world!" to `stdout`.
To keep it testable, you might want to mock the output destination, it might be the time for an interface ...
