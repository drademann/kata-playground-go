# The Prime Factors Kata

Robert Martin created this Kata:
[TDD Kata Prime Factors](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata)

Step by step, you’re supposed to implement a function that returns the prime factors of an integer.

__Remember__:

- Do TDD.
- Do one requirement at a time, don’t read ahead.
- Test first, there is no try.

## Task

Provide the following function

    PrimeFactors(n int) []int

## Requirements

1. The method takes a single integer parameter
2. and returns the prime factors of this integer in numerical order.

## Hints

See [Integer Factorization (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization)
for different algorithms available.
